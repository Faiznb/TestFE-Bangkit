# BrainStore: Blur or Bokeh Image Classifier for Marketplace

### Customer satisfaction is the most crucial for the marketplace. Unfortunately, poorly showcased product images often create confusion for customers, hindering seller success.

While manual review by humans is possible, this might cause slow processing times and potential human error, significantly decreasing marketplace efficiency. To address this challenge, BrainStore aims to revolutionize the process by automating image quality control through Machine Learning.

BrainStore's innovative solution acts as an automated validation system, ensuring that product images meet acceptable quality standards by classifying them into three categories: Blur, Bokeh, or HD. This system provides sellers with immediate feedback on their product images, allowing them to reupload images that do not meet the required standards, thus enhancing overall customer satisfaction and marketplace success.

To give sellers flexibility, BrainStore's system will be developed for both mobile and web platforms. Additionally, an admin role will be implemented to monitor the machine learning performance, ensuring the system effectively validates product images. With BrainStore, the marketplace can achieve higher efficiency, reduced error rates, and improved customer satisfaction through automated and reliable image quality control.
